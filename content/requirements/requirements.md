# Requirements

In order to best enjoy reading this short handbook, you should:

- Have a copy of Scribus installed on your computer. If this not the case, the last chapter of this handbook gives you some brief help on how to do it.
- A monitor that is big enough to show the preferences dialog (don't do your first steps on a netbook)
- have a good understanding of the basic usage of your mouse and keyboard for typical typing tasks

You should know how to use your mouse:

- Left button click (selects an item from a menu);
- Right button click (typically brings up some sort of context menu);
- Middle button click (or pressing the mousewheel, or both right and left buttons simultaneously);
- Click-drag (holding down a button in order to move an object on the page, then releasing, for example);
- Click-drag (making an imaginary box around a group of objects for example);
- Moving windows, dialogs, or frames on the display;

You should know how to use your keyboard:

- Key combinations (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, ...) along with other keys;
- Function keys (F1, F2, ...);

If this list looks a bit frightening, don't worry – you probably know these operations with some other terminology. In case you have some doubts, a bit of research on the internet, or consulting some basic book on computer usage will certainly clarify these concepts, and you likely have family or friends who can show you these various operations. Otherwise, at some point you will simply need to jump in to begin your learning process – with practice will come greater ease in using any program.

Now it's time to start your copy of Scribus and prepare you for going through its preferences!
