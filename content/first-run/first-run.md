# The first run

## Creating a new document

After having started Scribus, you will see the following dialog:

![The "New Document" default dialog.](images/boot-file-new.png)

If you have already closed it, don't worry: you will see it again the next time Scribus will start.  
You can simply use the "File > New" command to show the "New Document"  dialog.

In both cases, press the "Ok" button to create a new document. You can first have a look at the values and change them but, for your very first steps, the defaults are perfectly fine.

You should now have an empty white page in front of you.

![Close the "New Document" default dialog.](images/boot-file-new.png)

One short remark: If, instead of the "New Document" dialog you got a warning concerning the missing "Ghostscript":

![Missing Ghostscript](images/boot-file-new.png)

For now, you can safely ignore the dialog and click on "Ok". You will then see the "New Document" dialog.  
In the "Next steps" chapter at the end of this handbook you will learn where to look for more help with Ghostscript.
