# Trying out Scribus

- Create a new document;
- Create pages
- Add a text frame; double click on it to start typing; use the properties palette to type some text;
- Add an image frame; load an image

You can follow the "create a flyer with Scribus" and the "second steps with Scribus" manual to get started. (or should the flyer creation be integrated in the second steps?
