# Notes

Allow entries in the toc that do not lead to an own file but to the anchor on the parent level. or should those entries automatically be retrieved from the content of the file and added to the TOC as published?

## TOC

- Introduction
  - Scribus can be used as it is installed.
  - But there are a few tweaks that can make your experience better.
  - While going through the steps we suggest you, you will touch at some of the most important Scribus features. That's not bad either.
  - Scribus has slowly improved year after year and there are good chances that a few of the changes we propose will be the standard in the future (or some settings will be automatically detected for you)
- Setting up some basic preferences
    - Choose the UI language
      - Scribus comes with lot of translation, most of them are rather complete. (if not, rember that contributions are always welcome! link to the translation platform?)
    - Choose the measurement unit (inch or mm)
    - Choose the right default page size.
    - Choose the page formats you're likely to use (you don't have to add now all the formats you possible could use, just the one that are likey. for europe it would be A4, A5 and A6. if you're into doing posters A3 and A2. and for us?)
- Cleaning up the user interface
  - Scribus offers you lot of control on the way your text and images are layouted. This comes at a cost: there are many buttons, input boxes, dialogs filling your screen to get the work done. The following hints try to point you to some of the widgets that you can turn out without missing any (or very little... i mean the time to get used to the alternative or switching it on only when you used it) "lost".
  - Always maximise the scribus window (except if you have a very large monitor)
  - show the Properties Palette and put it on the right side of your Scribus window (on top of the Scribus window, not on right of it; except if you have a very wide monitor; in 1.5 it can be docked) and learn the F2 key to show and hide it. Refrain from moving it from keeping moving it around.
    - probably the most important place in Scribus: you will keep on using it
    - always at the same place for the brain muscles
  - hide all the toolbars but the tools.
    - from other applications, you might be used to open files, copy and paste or print through the toolbars: those are "slow" shortcuts. if you're happy with being slow, go for the the menues, if you want to be fast, learn the keyboard shortcuts: most of them are the same accross all applications and computers: it's a good investment to learn them.
    - if you notice that you really need them, you can always re-enable them later.
    - try to use the keyboard shortcuts instead of the toolbar buttons.
    - the only toolbar that you need is the Pdf one, and you only need to create interactive PDF forms (and this is a thing that most Scribus never or very rarely do: show it when you need it).
  - Move the tools tolbar to the left of the Scribus window and dock it there.
- Settings part two
  - disable showing the startup dialog (mostly you're faster by typing ctr-o and ctr-n to open or create a new document)
  - enable snapping (should already be on in 1.5 and not possible to enable on 1.4; move it to the first steps after creating a document?)
  - set ctrl-shift-p for producing a pdf and ctrl-alt-p for switching the preview mode
  - Set the default page margins to something you will mostly be using (for europe probably 1cm on each side)
  - In the tools
    - text: choose a meaningful default font (by default it's the first one, in alphabetical order, mostly a bold one).
      - On Linux and most free systems "DejaVu Sans Book"?
      - On OS X
      - On Windows
    - image: Scale image to frame size and keep ratio
    - setup the hyphenation language
      - if your language is not available, please refer to...
  - set the Preflight verifier to check for the most common PDF version for you. if in doubt choose 1.4 (really?).
- Colors, fonts, ...
  - You should not bother about them in your first steps with Scribus please refer to...
